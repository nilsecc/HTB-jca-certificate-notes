**Terminal / Shell / Console**  
A terminal (or shell, command line) is a text-based interface between the user and the kernel. It allows executing commands to control the system. The term console refers to a text-mode screen, not a window.

**Purpose of the Shell**  
Acts as a text-based interface to perform tasks like navigating directories, managing files, executing programs, and retrieving system information, with more flexibility and power than a GUI.

**Terminal Emulators**  
Software that emulates a terminal inside a graphical environment (GUI). They allow users to interact with the shell using text-based commands within a window.

**Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)**  
CLIs can run multiple terminals within one terminal session. They allow parallel command execution and multitasking.

**Terminal Multiplexers**  
Tools that extend terminal functionality by allowing multiple panes, sessions, and workspaces in a single terminal window. Example: tmux.

**Shell**  
The shell interprets user commands and communicates with the kernel. Everything done via GUI can also be done via the shell, often faster and more efficiently.

**Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)**  
The most commonly used Linux shell. Part of the GNU project. Supports scripting and automation, making repetitive tasks easier.

**Other Shells**  
Alternative shells include Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish, each with different features and user experience.

## Bash (type of shell)

**Bash Prompt**  
The Bash prompt is a line of text showing system readiness. By default, it displays **username**, **hostname**, and **current directory**, with a cursor waiting for commands.

**Default Symbols**

- `$` → regular user
- `#` → root user
- `~` → home directory

**PS1 Variable**  
Controls how the prompt looks. Can be customized to show:

- Username, hostname, current directory
- Colors, special characters
- Date, time, IP address, last command status

**Example Custom Prompt**

`<username>@<hostname>[<current directory>]$ root@htb[/htb]#`

**Useful Special Characters for PS1**

- `\u` → username
- `\h` → hostname
- `\w` → full path of current directory
- `\d` → date (Mon Feb 6)
- `\D{%Y-%m-%d}` → date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `\t` → time 24-hour (HH:MM:SS)
- `\T` → time 12-hour
- `\@` → time with AM/PM
- `\j` → number of jobs in shell
- `\n` → newline
- `\r` → carriage return
- `\s` → shell name

**Customization Benefits**

- Improves workflow and efficiency
- Helps track commands in penetration testing
- Makes terminal visually appealing
- Tools like **bash-prompt-generator** or **Powerline** can help adapt the prompt
