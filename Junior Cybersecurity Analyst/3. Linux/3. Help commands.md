**Getting Help**  
In Linux, it’s essential to know how to get help for commands and tools you don’t know. The main methods are **man pages**, **help flags**, and **search tools**.

**ls Command Example**  
`ls` lists files and directories in the current folder.

- `ls --help` → shows short help with options
- `man ls` → shows full manual with syntax, description, and options

**Symbols in Prompts**

- `$` → regular user prompt
- `#` → root prompt

**Man Pages (`man <tool>`)**

- Displays detailed documentation for a command
- Shows syntax, description, options, and examples

**Help Option (`--help` or `-h`)**

- Quick reference for command options
- Most commands support `--help` (some support `-h`)

**Apropos Tool (`apropos <keyword>`)**

- Searches man pages for a keyword
- Returns commands and a short description  
    Example: `apropos sudo` lists sudo-related commands
