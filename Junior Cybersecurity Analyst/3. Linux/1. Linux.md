# Introduction

**Linux Structure**  
Linux is an open-source operating system used on desktops, servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices. It is a core platform in cybersecurity due to stability, security, and flexibility. Exists in many distributions (distros) tailored to different needs.

**History**  
Linux originates from Unix (1970). GNU project (1983) aimed to create a free Unix-like OS. Linux kernel was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Licensed under GPLv2. Today it has millions of lines of code and hundreds of distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Mint, etc.).

**Why Linux is Important**  
More secure and stable than many OSs, less malware-prone, frequently updated. Open-source allows modification and redistribution. Used everywhere: servers, desktops, embedded systems, Android.

**Linux Distributions**  
Different versions of Linux built on the same kernel. Examples: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Linux Mint, Parrot OS. Parrot OS is security-focused and used for pentesting.

**Linux Philosophy**  
Based on simplicity, modularity, and openness. Uses small tools that do one thing well and can be combined. Configuration stored in text files and heavy use of the terminal.

**Core Principles**  
- Everything is a file.  
- Small single-purpose programs.  
- Programs can be chained together.  
- Avoid captive user interfaces (CLI preferred).  
- Configuration stored in text files (e.g. /etc/passwd).

**Main Components**  
- Bootloader: starts the OS (e.g. GRUB).  
- Kernel: manages hardware and system resources.  
- Daemons: background services.  
- Shell: command-line interface (Bash, Zsh, etc.).  
- Graphics Server: provides graphical support (X server).  
- Window Manager / GUI: graphical interface (GNOME, KDE, etc.).  
- Utilities: tools and applications.

**Linux Architecture**  
- Hardware: physical components.  
- Kernel: controls and virtualizes hardware resources.  
- Shell: interface between user and kernel.  
- System Utilities: provide OS functionality.

**File System Hierarchy**  
Linux uses a tree-like structure defined by the FHS standard.

**Root Directory (/)**  
Top-level directory containing everything required to boot and run the system.

**Important Directories**  
`/bin`: essential system commands.  
`/boot`: bootloader and kernel files.  
`/dev`: device files.  
`/etc`: system and application configuration.  
`/home`: user directories.  
`/lib`: essential shared libraries.  
`/media`: removable media mount points.  
`/mnt`: temporary mounts.  
`/opt`: optional and third-party software.  
`/root`: root user home directory.  
`/sbin`: system administration binaries.  
`/tmp`: temporary files.  
`/usr`: user programs, libraries, documentation.  
`/var`: variable data (logs, mail, web data).
